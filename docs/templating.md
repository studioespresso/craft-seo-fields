# Templating

## Template hook
To put SEO Fields on your html, just add `{% hook 'seo-fields' %}` within the `<head>` tag in your layout.

If you want more control over what the plugin output, you can include your own snippet instead of the templat hook. Have a look at the [default template](https://github.com/studioespresso/craft-seo-fields/blob/master/src/templates/_meta.twig) to get you started.

Note that the field looks for a field called `seo`. If it doesn't find that, it will not output anymore. 

[More information on that here.](field.html#field)

## Overwriting field values

::: danger Upgrading to version 4.0.0
The way to overwrite field values changes in version 4.0.
For example: instead of calling `entry.seo.setTwitterTitle()`, you should now call `entry.setTwitterTitle()`.
The same goes for other methods.

Both ``entry.setFacebookImage()`` and `entry.setTwitterImage()` now only take an Asset object, where they previously accept an Asset, an id or on AssetQuery.
:::

Next to the site defaults and the field, you might also want to use text and images from another fields.
 
To do this, use the following twig functions:

````twig

{% do entry.setSocialTitle('Facebook title') %}
{% do entry.setSocialDescription('custom description') %}


// Overwriting the image fields can be done by passing an Asset element
{% do entry.setSocialImage(entry.assetField.one()) %}
````

This is a normal Twig template so the usual conditionals and operators work here. You can use these for the fields that need a text value. For the OG and Twitter images, you can pass an ``Asset`` to ``meta.getOgImage()``, eg: ```{% set ogImage = meta.getOgImage(entry.overviewImage.one()) %}```.

## Support for custom elements

Out of the box SEO Fields has support for:
 - Craft's Entries
 - Craft's Categories
 - Commerce [Products](https://plugins.craftcms.com/commerce) 
 - Solspce Calendar [Events](https://plugins.craftcms.com/calendar)
 
 *If you have a plugin on the store that has a custom element and you want SEO Fields to add support for it, feel free to [get in touch](mailto:jan@studioespresso.co)*
 
 If you have a custom element of your own and you want to add support for SEO Fields, pass the element's class to the following event:

```php
Event::on(SeoFields::class, SeoFields::EVENT_SEOFIELDS_REGISTER_ELEMENT,
    function (RegisterSeoElementEvent $event) use ($elements) {
        $event->elements = array_merge($event->elements,[
            Product::class,
        ]);
    }
);
```
